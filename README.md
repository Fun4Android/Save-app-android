OpenArchive is a free, open-source mobile application dedicated to maintaining the privacy, provenance, and preservation of your media. You can add metadata and Creative Commons licensing to your audiovisual media and then send it to the Internet Archive via Tor. It offers more agency over your media, while protecting civil liberties and increasing interoperability for those interested in finding it and reusing it in the future.

OpenArchive was founded by Natalie Cadranel and developed in partnership with the Internet Archive, StoryMaker, and Scal.io with generous support from the Knight Foundation.
